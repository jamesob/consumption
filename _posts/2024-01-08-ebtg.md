I started listening to Everything But The Girl sometime back in 2012 or 2013 in New
York. That might seems somewhat unlikely given how prissy the music can be, but there
is some continuity between my teenage love of Steely Dan and the genre-spanning jazz
rock that EBTG put out over decades.

The first album of theirs I listened through many times was *The Language of Life*, which
has some great tunes on it. But I eventually cycled through their whole catalogue and
all of it is good, *Eden* probably being the one I've come back to most frequently.

The specific memory that hit me recently was when I moved to Chicago for a few months
in the dead of winter. That was my apartment, above. I remember driving to Microcenter
through the ice and snow covered city, playing *Mirrorball* and *Big Deal* a bunch. 

I loved Chicago, and especially that apartment. It was dirt cheap at $1600/mo. - for
two bedrooms no less! Those few months were a sequence in my life that I wish had
gotten more time.

Everything But The Girl is worth spending some time with. Tracy Thorn's biography,
*Bedsit Disco Queen*, was also a fun read. And *Walking Wounded* is a particularly good
album that reminds me of snowy midwestern streets and empty electronics stores.
