[Metropolitan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100142/) is a holiday comedy of
manners released in 1990, and is the first movie in Whit Stillman's
"Doomed-Bourgeois-in-Love" series. It feels like an upscale John
Hughes-does-Clerks in New York kind of thing. The dialogue is snappy and the
pacing of the movie is perfect; never a down moment but somehow the film feels
atmospheric.

The script makes the characters, preppy first year college students,
endearingly precocious and insightful but equally snobbish-but-well-meaning and
inexperienced in a way that's entertaining and funny. The romantic angle of the
movie is novel and the lead girl, Audrey Rouget, is near perfect.

I'm amazed that more people haven't heard of this movie.

The sort-of sequel, [The Last Days of
Disco](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120728/) comes recommended. I've watched
the second in the series, [Barcelona](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109219/),
but it didn't really leave an impression.
