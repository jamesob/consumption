Metropolitan is a holiday comedy of manners released in 1990. It feels like an
upscale John Hughes-does-Clerks in New York kind of thing. The dialogue is
snappy and the pacing of the movie is perfect; never a down moment but somehow
the film feels atmospheric.

The script makes the characters endearingly precocious and insightful but
equally snobbish-but-well-meaning and inexperienced in a way that's
entertaining and funny. The romantic angle of the movie is novel and the female
protagonist, Audrey Rouget, is near perfect.

I'm amazed more people haven't heard of this movie.
