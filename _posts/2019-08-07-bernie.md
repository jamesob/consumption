Listened to Bernie Sanders give his spiel to Joe Rogan for about an hour. It
dawned on me that hell would be listening to Rogan do ad reads for anything
over 10 minutes.

The conversation made me realize how doomed the US is - Bernie's puerile
understanding of healthcare, drug markets, minimum wage, etc. probably sound
completely compelling and sensible to someone who hasn't spent more a decent
amount of time thinking about microecon. I can totally see what he's saying
resonate with most of the country.

No surprise anywhere here, just figured I'd indulge a little masochism and
check in with dem politics.
